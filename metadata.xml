[h1]PLEASE READ BELOW![/h1]

(Be sure to uninstall the old AB+ Eevee! There will obviously be compatibility issues)

Eevee: Reunited is an overhaul project of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1809450880]Eevee Mod for Afterbirth+[/url]. This aims to reunite every Eeveelution back to Eevee as the original mod always meant to do, all with unique attacks, many unique Pokémon-themed items, and much more. This is a demo release that will slowly gain updates over time for the purpose of gaining support for the project, receiving feedback, and putting forward the quality you can expect for the full release. If you would like to follow development or directly contribute to the mod, join the Discord Server linked below. We're looking for spriters and artists, but coders are also welcome. Enjoy the mod!

Everything you can expect from downloading the mod.
[list]
[*]1 new character: Eevee - Fight through with your charge-up move, Swift!
[*]While firing, summon orbiting stars around you. Once 5 stars are summoned or you let go of firing, they will be unleashed forth and home in on enemies! Note: This attack can miss.
[*]40+ item synergies! Most of your favorite attack-changing items and unique effects for certain items.
[*]Unique costume support! Eevee has 700+ unique costume sprites, and any costumes that would otherwise harm Eevee are automatically removed on the spot!
[*]Birthright: Tail Whip! With this secondary move, keep your distance by knocking back any harm that comes your way, and lowering the defense of enemies.
[*]A full set of character unlocks and a new pickup type: Poke Ball!
[*]A new challenge: 'Pokey Mans: Crystal'. Fight using only your Pokemon and defeat Mom!

When the mod is done, it’ll be made into a separate upload. The demo has reached the point where it's satisfactory of the quality you can expect in the full release, and will no longer receive major updates. The full release will include:
[list]
[*]All 8 Eeveelutions, only able to be obtained in a run through Eevee, each with their own unique attacks, costumes, and birthrights.
[*]Tainted Eevee, who’s gimmick surrounds mix-matching Eeveelution abilities
[*]Collectibles, pickups, and trinkets tied to character unlocks for Tainted Eevee as well as random unlock, all based on various Pokémon items.
[*]Secrets???
